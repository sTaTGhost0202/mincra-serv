[23:39:29] [main/ERROR]: Incompatible mods found!
net.fabricmc.loader.impl.FormattedException: Some of your mods are incompatible with the game or each other!
A potential solution has been determined, this may resolve your problem:
	 - Install ftbquests, any version.
	 - Replace mod 'Fabric Loader' (fabricloader) 0.16.9 with version 0.16.10 or later.
More details:
	 - Mod 'Create Questing' (create_questing) 1.0.0 requires any version of ftbquests, which is missing!
	 - Mod 'Marium's Soulslike Weaponry' (soulsweapons) 1.2.1-1.20.1-fabric requires version 0.16.10 or later of mod 'Fabric Loader' (fabricloader), but only the wrong version is present: 0.16.9!
